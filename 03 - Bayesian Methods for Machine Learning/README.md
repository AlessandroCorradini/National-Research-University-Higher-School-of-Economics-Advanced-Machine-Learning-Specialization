**The Advanced Machine Learning Specialization from National Research University Higher School of Economics, is an advanced level path, maybe the hardest specialization on Coursera. You need to study a lot before you taking this specialization. Data Science is one of the hardest subfield of Computer Science and requires a lot of study and hard work.**
