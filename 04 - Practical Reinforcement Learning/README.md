# Practical Reinforcement Learning from National Research University Higher School of Economics

## Overview
[Practical Reinforcement Learning from National Research University Higher School of Economics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-rl?specialization=aml) is an advanced learning course for the Machine Learning world with focus on Neural Networks and their applications.

## This Course covers:

- foundations of RL methods: value/policy iteration, q-learning, policy gradient, etc. with math & batteries included
- using deep neural networks for RL tasks also known as "the hype train"
- state of the art RL algorithms and how to apply duct tape to them for practical problems.
- and, of course, teaching your neural network to play games because that's what everyone thinks RL is about. We'll also use it for seq2seq and contextual bandits.

## Course Content:

- Intro: why should i care?
- At the heart of RL: Dynamic Programming
- Model-free methods
- Approximate Value Based Methods
- Policy-based methods
- Exploration

**The Advanced Machine Learning Specialization from National Research University Higher School of Economics, is an advanced level path, maybe the hardest specialization on Coursera. You need to study a lot before you taking this specialization. Data Science is one of the hardest subfield of Computer Science and requires a lot of study and hard work.**
