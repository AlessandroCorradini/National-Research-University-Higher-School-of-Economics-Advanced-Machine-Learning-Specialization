But due to their sparsity incidence matrices **can be easily represented as sparse matrices**. If you are not familiar with sparse matrices, please see [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) and [scipy.sparse reference](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html).

We highly recommend to learn to use different `scipy.sparse` constuctors, and matrices types, but if you feel you don't want to use them, you can always build this matrix with a simple `for` loop. You will need first to create a matrix using `scipy.sparse.coo_matrix((M, N), [dtype])` with an appropriate shape `(M, N)` and then iterate through `(FirstId, SecondId)` pairs and fill corresponding elements in matrix with ones. \n",
