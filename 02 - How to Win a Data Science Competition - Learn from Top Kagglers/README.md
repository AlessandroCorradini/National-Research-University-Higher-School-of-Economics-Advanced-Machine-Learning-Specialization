# How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers from National Research University Higher School of Economics

## Overview
[How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers from National Research University Higher School of Economics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/competitive-data-science?specialization=aml) is an advanced learning course for the Machine Learning world with focus on Neural Networks and their applications.


## This course covers:

- Understand how to solve predictive modelling competitions efficiently and learn which of the skills obtained can be applicable to real-world tasks.
- Learn how to preprocess the data and generate new features from various sources such as text and images.
- Be taught advanced feature engineering techniques like generating mean-encodings, using aggregated statistical measures or finding nearest neighbors as a means to improve your predictions.
- Be able to form reliable cross validation methodologies that help you benchmark your solutions and avoid overfitting or underfitting when tested with unobserved (test) data. 
- Gain experience of analysing and interpreting the data. You will become aware of inconsistencies, high noise levels, errors and other data-related issues such as leakages and you will learn how to overcome them. 
- Acquire knowledge of different algorithms and learn how to efficiently tune their hyperparameters and achieve top performance. 
- Master the art of combining different machine learning models and learn how to ensemble. 
- Get exposed to past (winning) solutions and codes and learn how to read them.

**The Advanced Machine Learning Specialization from National Research University Higher School of Economics, is an advanced level path, maybe the hardest specialization on Coursera. You need to study a lot before you taking this specialization. Data Science is one of the hardest subfield of Computer Science and requires a lot of study and hard work.**
