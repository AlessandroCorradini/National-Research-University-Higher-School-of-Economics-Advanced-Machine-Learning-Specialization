    "\n",
    "You will need to implement a number of features, that were one of the key features, that leaded the instructors to prizes in [Otto](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge) and [Springleaf](https://www.kaggle.com/c/springleaf-marketing-response) competitions. Of course, the list of features you will need to implement can be extended, in fact in competitions the list was at least 3 times larger. So when solving a real competition do not hesitate to make up your own features.   \n",

    "You can optionally implement multicore feature computation. Nearest neighbours are hard to compute so it is preferable to have a parallel version of the algorithm. In fact, it is really a cool skill to know how to use `multiprocessing`, `joblib` and etc. In this homework you will have a chance to see the benefits of parallel algorithm. "
