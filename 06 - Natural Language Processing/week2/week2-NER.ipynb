    "# Recognize named entities on Twitter with LSTMs\n",

    "In this assignment, you will use a recurrent neural network to solve Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem. NER is a common task in natural language processing systems. It serves for extraction such entities from the text as persons, organizations, locations, etc. In this task you will experiment to recognize named entities from Twitter.\n",

    "Could we say that our model is state of the art and the results are acceptable for the task? Definately, we can say so. Nowadays, Bi-LSTM is one of the state of the art approaches for solving NER problem and it outperforms other classical methods. Despite the fact that we used small training corpora (in comparison with usual sizes of corpora in Deep Learning), our results are quite good. In addition, in this task there are many possible named entities and for some of them we have only several dozens of trainig examples, which is definately small. However, the implemented model outperforms classical CRFs for this task. Even better results could be obtained by some combinations of several types of methods, e.g. see [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01354) paper if you are interested."
